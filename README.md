# TodoList-JS
A To Do List built with Javascript, CSS, &amp; HTML. Styled with Bootstrap. 

This project uses DOM manipulation and the use of an array to maintain a Javascript To Do List. 

Every time the array is changed, the list reprints to the screen. 

Each item in the list is printed with it's own HTML elements.
